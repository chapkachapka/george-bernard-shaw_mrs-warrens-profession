			<sd-line>Inside the cottage after nightfall. Looking eastward from within instead of westward from without, the latticed window, with its curtains drawn, is now seen in the middle of the front wall of the cottage, with the porch door to the left of it. In the left-hand side wall is the door leading to the kitchen. Farther back against the same wall is a dresser with a candle and matches on it, and Frank’s rifle standing beside them, with the barrel resting in the plate-rack. In the centre a table stands with a lighted lamp on it. Vivie’s books and writing materials are on a table to the right of the window, against the wall. The fireplace is on the right, with a settle: there is no fire. Two of the chairs are set right and left of the table.</sd-line>
			<sd-line>The cottage door opens, showing a fine starlit night without; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren, her shoulders wrapped in a shawl borrowed from Vivie, enters, followed by Frank, who throws his cap on the window seat. She has had enough of walking, and gives a gasp of relief as she unpins her hat; takes it off; sticks the pin through the crown; and puts it on the table.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>O Lord! I don’t know which is the worst of the country, the walking or the sitting at home with nothing to do. I could do with a whisky and soda now very well, if only they had such a things in this place.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Perhaps Vivie’s got some.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Nonsense! What would a young girl like her be doing with such things! Never mind: it don’t matter. I wonder how she passes her time here! I’d a good deal rather be in Vienna.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Let me take you there. <sd>He helps her to take off her shawl, gallantly giving her shoulders a very perceptible squeeze as he does so.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Ah! would you? I’m beginning to think you’re a chip of the old block.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Like the gov’nor, eh? <sd>He hangs the shawl on the nearest chair, and sits down.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Never you mind. What do you know about such things? You’re only a boy. <sd>She goes to the hearth to be farther from temptation.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Do come to Vienna with me? It’d be ever such larks.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>No, thank you. Vienna is no place for you⁠—at least not until you’re a little older. <sd>She nods at him to emphasize this piece of advice. He makes a mock-piteous face, belied by his laughing eyes. She looks at him; then comes back to him.</sd> Now, look here, little boy <sd>taking his face in her hands and turning it up to her</sd>: I know you through and through by your likeness to your father, better than you know yourself. Don’t you go taking any silly ideas into your head about me. Do you hear?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Gallantly wooing her with his voice.</sd> Can’t help it, my dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren: it runs in the family.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>She pretends to box his ears; then looks at the pretty laughing upturned face of a moment, tempted. At last she kisses him, and immediately turns away, out of patience with herself.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>There! I shouldn’t have done that. I <em>am</em> wicked. Never you mind, my dear: it’s only a motherly kiss. Go and make love to Vivie.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>So I have.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Turning on him with a sharp note of alarm in her voice.</sd> What!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Vivie and I are ever such chums.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>What do you mean? Now see here: I won’t have any young scamp tampering with my little girl. Do you hear? I won’t have it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Quite unabashed.</sd> My dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren: don’t you be alarmed. My intentions are honorable: ever so honorable; and your little girl is jolly well able to take care of herself. She don’t need looking after half so much as her mother. She ain’t so handsome, you know.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Taken aback by his assurance.</sd> Well, you have got a nice healthy two inches of cheek all over you. I don’t know where you got it. Not from your father, anyhow.</speech>

				<speaker>Crofts</speaker>

				<speech>Well, she oughtn’t to go off like that without telling me. <sd>To Frank</sd> Get your father a chair, Frank: where are your manners? <sd>Frank springs up and gracefully offers his father his chair; then takes another from the wall and sits down at the table, in the middle, with his father on his right and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren on his left.</sd> George: where are you going to stay tonight?

				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>

			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, it’s all right, gov’nor. He built that place down in Wales for the Duke. Caernarvon Castle they call it. You must have heard of it. <sd>He winks with lightning smartness at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren, and regards his father blandly.</sd></speech>

				<speech>Better not wait for them, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren. Praed will stay out as long as possible. He has never known before what it is to stray over the heath on a summer night with my Vivie.</speech>

				<speaker>Frank</speaker>

			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Crofts</speaker>
				<speech><sd>To <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren.</sd> I suppose you don’t want to marry the girl to a man younger than herself and without either a profession or twopence to keep her on.

				<speech>Not another penny. He has had his patrimony; and he spent the last of it in July. <sd><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren’s face falls.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Crofts</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Watching her</sd> There! I told you. <sd>He resumes his place on the settle and puts his legs on the seat again, as if the matter were finally disposed of.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Plaintively.</sd> This is ever so mercenary. Do you suppose Miss Warren’s going to marry for money? If we love one another⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Thank you. Your love’s a pretty cheap commodity, my lad. If you have no means of keeping a wife, that settles it; you can’t have Vivie.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Much amused.</sd> What do <em>you</em> say, gov’nor, eh?</speech>
			</line>

					<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr>
					<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr>

				<speech>I agree with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren.</speech>

				<speech>And good old Crofts has already expressed his opinion.</speech>

				<speech><sd>Turning angrily on his elbow.</sd> Look here: I want none of your cheek.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Pointedly.</sd> I’m <em>ever</em> so sorry to surprise you, Crofts; but you allowed yourself the liberty of speaking to me like a father a moment ago. One father is enough, thank you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Crofts</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Contemptuously</sd> Yah! <sd>He turns away again.</sd></speech>

			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Continuing.</sd> And as you no doubt intend to hold out other prospects to her, I shall lose no time in placing my case before her. <sd>They stare at him; and he begins to declaim gracefully</sd> He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, That dares not put it to the touch, To gain or lose it all.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>The cottage doors open whilst he is reciting; and Vivie and Praed come in. He breaks off. Praed puts his hat on the dresser. There is an immediate improvement in the company’s behavior. Crofts takes down his legs from the settle and pulls himself together as Praed joins him at the fireplace. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren loses her ease of manner and takes refuge in querulousness.</sd-line>

				<speech>Wherever have you been, Vivie?</speech>

			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Well, you shouldn’t go off like that without letting me know. How could I tell what had become of you? And night coming on too!</speech>

				<speech>Did you hear what I said, Vivie?</speech>

				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Decisively</sd> There’s no need.

Praed and Crofts follow. All except Praed clearly disapprove of the arrangement, but do not know how to resist it. Vivie stands at the door looking in at them.</sd> Can you squeeze past to that corner, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Praed: it’s rather a tight fit. Take care of your coat against the whitewash: that right. Now, are you all comfortable?</speech>

			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Within</sd> Leave the door open, dearie. <sd>Vivie frowns; but Frank checks her with a gesture, and steals to the cottage door, which he softly sets wide open.</sd> Oh Lor, what a draught! Youd better shut it, dear.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Vivie shuts it with a slam, and then, noting with disgust that her mother’s hat and shawl are lying about, takes them tidily to the window seat, whilst Frank noiselessly shuts the cottage door.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Exulting.</sd> Aha! Got rid of em. Well, Vivvums: what do you think of my governor?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Preoccupied and serious.</sd> I’ve hardly spoken to him. He doesn’t strike me as a particularly able person.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Well, you know, the old man is not altogether such a fool as he looks. You see, he was shoved into the Church, rather; and in trying to live up to it he makes a much bigger ass of himself than he really is. I don’t dislike him as much as you might expect. He means well. How do you think youll get on with him?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Rather grimly.</sd> I don’t think my future life will be much concerned with him, or with any of that old circle of my mother’s, except perhaps Praed. <sd>She sits down on the settle</sd> What do you think of my mother?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Really and truly?</speech>

				<speech>Yes, really and truly.</speech>

				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Well, she’s ever so jolly. But she’s rather a caution, isn’t she? And Crofts! Oh, my eye, Crofts! <sd>He sits beside her.</sd></speech>

			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>What a lot, Frank!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>What a crew!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With intense contempt for them.</sd> If I thought that <em>I</em> was like that⁠—that I was going to be a waster, shifting along from one meal to another with no purpose, and no character, and no grit in me, I’d open an artery and bleed to death without one moment’s hesitation.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Frank</speaker>
				<speech>Oh no, you wouldn’t. Why should they take any grind when they can afford not to? I wish I had their luck. No: what I object to is their form. It isn’t the thing: it’s slovenly, ever so slovenly.</speech>

				<speech>No, you don’t. I do. She called herself a widow and had a fried-fish shop down by the Mint, and kept herself and four daughters out of it. Two of us were sisters: that was me and Liz; and we were both good-looking and well made. I suppose our father was a well-fed man: mother pretended he was a gentleman; but I don’t know. The other two were only half sisters: undersized, ugly, starved looking, hard working, honest poor creatures: Liz and I would have half-murdered them if mother hadn’t half-murdered us to keep our hands off them. They were the respectable ones. Well, what did they get by their respectability? I’ll tell you. One of them worked in a white lead factory twelve hours a day for nine shillings a week until she died of lead poisoning. She only expected to get her hands a little paralyzed; but she died. The other was always held up to us as a model because she married a Government laborer in the Deptford victualling yard, and kept his room and the three children neat and tidy on eighteen shillings a week⁠—until he took to drink. That was worth being respectable for, wasn’t it?</speech>

				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Now thoughtfully attentive.</sd> Did you and your sister think so?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Liz didn’t, I can tell you: she had more spirit. We both went to a church school⁠—that was part of the ladylike airs we gave ourselves to be superior to the children that knew nothing and went nowhere⁠—and we stayed there until Liz went out one night and never came back. I know the schoolmistress thought I’d soon follow her example; for the clergyman was always warning me that Lizzie’d end by jumping off Waterloo Bridge. Poor fool: that was all he knew about it! But I was more afraid of the white lead factory than I was of the river; and so would you have been in my place. That clergyman got me a situation as a scullery maid in a temperance restaurant where they sent out for anything you liked. Then I was a waitress; and then I went to the bar at Waterloo station: fourteen hours a day serving drinks and washing glasses for four shillings a week and my board. That was considered a great promotion for me. Well, one cold, wretched night, when I was so tired I could hardly keep myself awake, who should come up for a half of Scotch but Lizzie, in a long fur cloak, elegant and comfortable, with a lot of sovereigns in her purse.</speech>

			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Grimly.</sd> My aunt Lizzie!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Yes; and a very good aunt to have, too. She’s living down at Winchester now, close to the cathedral, one of the most respectable ladies there. Chaperones girls at the country ball, if you please. No river for Liz, thank you! You remind me of Liz a little: she was a first-rate business woman⁠—saved money from the beginning⁠—never let herself look too like what she was⁠—never lost her head or threw away a chance. When she saw I’d grown up good-looking she said to me across the bar “What are you doing there, you little fool? wearing out your health and your appearance for other people’s profit!” Liz was saving money then to take a house for herself in Brussels; and she thought we two could save faster than one. So she lent me some money and gave me a start; and I saved steadily and first paid her back, and then went into business with her as a partner. Why shouldn’t I have done it? The house in Brussels was real high class: a much better place for a woman to be in than the factory where Anne Jane got poisoned. None of the girls were ever treated as I was treated in the scullery of that temperance place, or at the Waterloo bar, or at home. Would you have had me stay in them and become a worn out old drudge before I was forty?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Intensely interested by this time.</sd> No; but why did you choose that business? Saving money and good management will succeed in any business.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, saving money. But where can a woman get the money to save in any other business? Could <em>you</em> save out of four shillings a week and keep yourself dressed as well? Not you. Of course, if you’re a plain woman and can’t earn anything more; or if you have a turn for music, or the stage, or newspaper-writing: thats different. But neither Liz nor I had any turn for such things at all: all we had was our appearance and our turn for pleasing men. Do you think we were such fools as to let other people trade in our good looks by employing us as shopgirls, or barmaids, or waitresses, when we could trade in them ourselves and get all the profits instead of starvation wages? Not likely.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>You were certainly quite justified⁠—from the business point of view.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Yes; or any other point of view. What is any respectable girl brought up to do but to catch some rich man’s fancy and get the benefit of his money by marrying him?⁠—as if a marriage ceremony could make any difference in the right or wrong of the thing! Oh, the hypocrisy of the world makes me sick! Liz and I had to work and save and calculate just like other people; elseways we should be as poor as any good-for-nothing drunken waster of a woman that thinks her luck will last forever. <sd>With great energy</sd> I despise such people: theyve no character; and if theres a thing I hate in a woman, it’s want of character.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>Come now, mother: frankly! Isn’t it part of what you call character in a woman that she should greatly dislike such a way of making money?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Why, of course. Everybody dislikes having to work and make money; but they have to do it all the same. I’m sure I’ve often pitied a poor girl, tired out and in low spirits, having to try to please some man that she doesn’t care two straws for⁠—some half-drunken fool that thinks he’s making himself agreeable when he’s teasing and worrying and disgusting a woman so that hardly any money could pay her for putting up with it. But she has to bear with disagreeables and take the rough with the smooth, just like a nurse in a hospital or anyone else. It’s not work that any woman would do for pleasure, goodness knows; though to hear the pious people talk you would suppose it was a bed of roses.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>Still, you consider it worth while. It pays.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Of course it’s worth while to a poor girl, if she can resist temptation and is good-looking and well conducted and sensible. It’s far better than any other employment open to her. I always thought that it oughtn’t to be. It <em>can’t</em> be right, Vivie, that there shouldn’t be better opportunities for women. I stick to that: it’s wrong. But it’s so, right or wrong; and a girl must make the best of it. But of course it’s not worth while for a lady. If you took to it youd be a fool; but I should have been a fool if I’d taken to anything else.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>More and more deeply moved.</sd> Mother: suppose we were both as poor as you were in those wretched old days, are you quite sure that you wouldn’t advise me to try the Waterloo bar, or marry a laborer, or even go into the factory?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Indignantly.</sd> Of course not. What sort of mother do you take me for! How could you keep your self-respect in such starvation and slavery? And whats a woman worth? whats life worth? without self-respect! Why am I independent and able to give my daughter a first-rate education, when other women that had just as good opportunities are in the gutter? Because I always knew how to respect myself and control myself. Why is Liz looked up to in a cathedral town? The same reason. Where would we be now if we’d minded the clergyman’s foolishness? Scrubbing floors for one and sixpence a day and nothing to look forward to but the workhouse infirmary. Don’t you be led astray by people who don’t know the world, my girl. The only way for a woman to provide for herself decently is for her to be good to some man that can afford to be good to her. If she’s in his own station of life, let her make him marry her; but if she’s far beneath him she can’t expect it: why should she? it wouldn’t be for her own happiness. Ask any lady in London society that has daughters; and she’ll tell you the same, except that I tell you straight and she’ll tell you crooked. Thats all the difference.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Fascinated, gazing at her.</sd> My dear mother: you are a wonderful woman: you are stronger than all England. And are you really and truly not one wee bit doubtful⁠—or⁠—or⁠—ashamed?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech>Well, of course, dearie, it’s only good manners to be ashamed of it: it’s expected from a woman. Women have to pretend to feel a great deal that they don’t feel. Liz used to be angry with me for plumping out the truth about it. She used to say that when every woman could learn enough from what was going on in the world before her eyes, there was no need to talk about it to her. But then Liz was such a perfect lady! She had the true instinct of it; while I was always a bit of a vulgarian. I used to be so pleased when you sent me your photos to see that you were growing up like Liz: you’ve just her ladylike, determined way. But I can’t stand saying one thing when everyone knows I mean another. Whats the use in such hypocrisy? If people arrange the world that way for women, theres no good pretending it’s arranged the other way. No: I never was a bit ashamed really. I consider I had a right to be proud of how we managed everything so respectably, and never had a word against us, and how the girls were so well taken care of. Some of them did very well: one of them married an ambassador. But of course now I daren’t talk about such things: whatever would they think of us! <sd>She yawns.</sd> Oh dear! I do believe I’m getting sleepy after all. <sd>She stretches herself lazily, thoroughly relieved by her explosion, and placidly ready for her night’s rest.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>I believe it is I who will not be able to sleep now. <sd>She goes to the dresser and lights the candle. Then she extinguishes the lamp, darkening the room a good deal.</sd> Better let in some fresh air before locking up. <sd>She opens the cottage door, and finds that it is broad moonlight.</sd> What a beautiful night! Look! <sd>She draws the curtains of the window. The landscape is seen bathed in the radiance of the harvest moon rising over Blackdown.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With a perfunctory glance at the scene.</sd> Yes, dear; but take care you don’t catch your death of cold from the night air.</speech>
			</line>

				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Contemptuously.</sd> Nonsense.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Querulously.</sd> Oh yes: everything I say is nonsense, according to you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Turning to her quickly.</sd> No: really that is not so, mother. You have got completely the better of me tonight, though I intended it to be the other way. Let us be good friends now.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Shaking her head a little ruefully.</sd> So it <em>has</em> been the other way. But I suppose I must give in to it. I always got the worst of it from Liz; and now I suppose it’ll be the same with you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Vivie</speaker>
				<speech>Well, never mind. Come: good night, dear old mother. <sd>She takes her mother in her arms.</sd></speech>
